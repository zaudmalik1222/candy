# NFT Collection Deployment on Solana using Sugar Candy Machine

This project demonstrates how to deploy an NFT collection on the Solana blockchain using Sugar Candy Machine. Sugar Candy Machine simplifies the process of creating and managing CandyMachines for minting NFTs on Solana.

## Description

This repository provides the necessary code and steps to deploy an NFT collection on Solana using Sugar Candy Machine. It includes scripts and configurations to set up the CandyMachine and mint NFTs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- Solana Command-Line Tools (`@solana/web3.js`, `@project-serum/anchor`) installed
- Wallet with SOL for transaction fees

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solana-nft-collection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd solana-nft-collection
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

1. Create a new `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   MNEMONIC="your wallet mnemonic"
   RPC_ENDPOINT="https://api.devnet.solana.com"
   CANDY_MACHINE_CONFIG="config/candy-machine-config.json"
   WALLET_PK_PATH="config/wallet-keypair.json"
   ```
   - `MNEMONIC`: Your wallet's mnemonic (seed phrase)
   - `RPC_ENDPOINT`: Solana cluster's RPC endpoint (Devnet used in the documentation)
   - `CANDY_MACHINE_CONFIG`: Path to the CandyMachine config file
   - `WALLET_PK_PATH`: Path to your wallet's keypair JSON file

2. Update the `candy-machine-config.json` file with your NFT metadata, royalty percentage, and minting fees.

### Deploying CandyMachine

1. Run the deployment script:
   ```bash
   node scripts/deploy.js
   ```

2. This will deploy the CandyMachine on Solana and output the newly created CandyMachine address.

### Minting NFTs

1. Update the `scripts/mint.js` file with the CandyMachine address.

2. Run the minting script:
   ```bash
   node scripts/mint.js
   ```

3. This will mint new NFTs using the CandyMachine.
